## Projects

* [Clock module](/clock-module): A compact clock with adjustable speed (1-480Hz) and step-by-step. Useful for debugging sequential circuits.
* [Display module](/output-module): A breadboard circuit to display 8-bit values in decimal/hex with support for both signed and unsigned numbers.
* [Logic gates](/logic-gates): An exploration of different technologies and designs to build logic gates.

## Other videos

* [Practical Theory](https://siliconchronicles.github.io/practical-theory/): This series of videos presents electronics theory in a way that can be experimented with and easily applied.
